	<br><p1> <b> Mission Statement: </b> The mission of Recycling 2.0 Bigger & Better is to provide awareness about the importance of waste management services, protecting the environment, and promote recycling in order to ensure a safe and healthy community for current and future generations. Building an effective recycling plan that adopts and is consistently used by Frank Sinatra School of the Arts to reduce its carbon footprint or aid in the reduction of ill-disposed biohazardous material. With the help of students, parents, and faculty we can extend this plan to schools around FSSA, with the hope to inspire residents of Astoria to better conserve our illustrious planet.</p1></br>

	<br><p2> <b> Info: </b> We are passionate about NYC eco-consciousness and environmental science.Working with custodians and school staff, we plan to install a composting tumbler at our schoolâ€™s rooftop garden, recycling the organic compost to utilize in the gardening of flora. This would not only reduce our carbon footprint and aid in the reduction of ill-disposed biohazardous material, it would allow students to employ their talents to engage with academic material through various frameworks. With the help of students, parents, and faculty we can extend this plan to schools around FSSA, with the hope to inspire residents of Astoria to better conserve our illustrious planet. </p2></br>
