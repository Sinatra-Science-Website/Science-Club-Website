	<h1>Bat Rescue</h1>	
	<br><p1> <b> Mission Statement: </b>The FSSA Bat Society is passionate about NYC wildlife conservation and environmental science. Working with Alley Pond Environmental Center, we plan to install bat houses at the Alley Pond Park, and monitor Bat behavior as well as set up hibernation centers for these species to utilize during the winter months and rough seasons. We fundraised to buy houses for bats that are losing their habitats all around the world. By installing bat boxes, we are providing a safe area for them to stay during their migration period. .</p1></br>

	<br><p2> <b> Info: </b> Our group wants to place bat houses at Alley Pond which will be monitored monthly by some of the members of our group. This is a field research project as we are observing the interaction of bats with the houses we installed. The bat houses are sustainable allowing this project to continue for many years as they do not need to be refurbished frequently. </p2></br>
