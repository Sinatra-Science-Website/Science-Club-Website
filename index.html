	<h1> Frank Sinatra School of the Arts' Science Club </h1>

	<br><p1> Hello and welcome to FSSA's Science Club! </p1></br>

	<br><p2> The FSSA science club is a collection of smaller scientific agendas and activities within Frank Sinatra School of the Arts. The club was formed with the intention of having a Science Olympiad type of competitive science team and Science National Honors Society (SNHS) all under one umbrella. The club then expanded to the "science club" with the intention of being more inclusive of all students who share an interest and a passion for the sciences even if their GPA might not be reflective of SNHS's desired requirements. This by effect will then allow for students who are struggling with science academically but find a great interest in the subject matter to make vital connections with students who can help them to form study groups and improve their overall GPA and extrapolate a more rewarding experience from academic science classes. </p2><br>

	<br><p3> In our club we celebrate academic and personal successes in the science club and we are building a warm and encouraging environment for all students. Students often share when accepted to prestigious colleges, universities, internships or scientific extracurricular programs here in NYC and beyond. Our club discusses scientifically relevant current events during each meeting and the ethical implications of science so that students can not only discuss hot topics in science with confidence and passion but also understand the nuances of these issues. We help each other to acquire skills and resources that enrich our minds and resumes. We also believe in service to our communities and school - completing service hours is a key component of matriculating into SNHS where students create and take-on projects that not only have a scientific lense, but also improve our communities and schools by encouraging all around us to become more scientifically literate and aware. </p3></br>

	<br><p4> Come and see some of the projects we have been working on this year!! </p4></br>
